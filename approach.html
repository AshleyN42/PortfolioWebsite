    <p>My approach to art and design has always been more personal. I like looking into topics that I can relate to, but I don't mind looking outside the box. In fact, I like to learn about new things in the art and design sphere. I think that art is a very important aspect of our lives, and that art is a valuable part of our part in human history. Humans have always made art, and they will continue to make art into the future. Anyone can create art; it just takes time to perfect that skill.</p>
